# 📺 Tune In
Tune In is a web application built during a 4 day "Stackathon" at the [Grace Hopper Program](https://www.gracehopper.com/) at Fullstack Academy. This application was inspired by the nostalgia I had from when my friend and I used to listen to same music together online. Now, more commonly, Tune In allows my friends and I to stream the same YouTube videos together all while chatting and sharing our thoughts. 

Through this project, I had a lot of fun implementing the YouTube Player API with Socket.io.
